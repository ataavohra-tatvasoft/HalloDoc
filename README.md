Project: HalloDoc

Description:
This project aims to develop a web-based platform that facilitates online doctor consultations and diagnostic services. Inspired by the Halodoc platform, it strives to create a user-friendly experience for both doctors and patients.

Features:
Online Doctor Consultation: Patients can connect with doctors virtually for consultations, reducing the need for physical visits.
Diagnostics Services: The platform may integrate with third-party services to enable patients to access diagnostic tests and receive results securely. (Implementation details depend on integration feasibility)
User Roles:
Admin: Manages the platform, including user accounts, patient records, and appointment requests. Can review patient history, manage cases, and control requests (cancel, block).
Physician: Offers consultations online, manages patient appointments, accesses patient medical records securely, and communicates with patients through the platform.
Patient: Seeks online consultations, requests diagnostic services (if available), manages appointments, and securely communicates with doctors.
